# Demo Repo

This repo was created by me to learn the basics of Git and Github. It isnt really meant to do anything, just like the appendix in the Human body.

This update is to practise the process of a repo update. (Again, useless).

## VSCode Migration

This update is the first one made to test out cloning into VS Code, and commiting it locally and on the remote repo.
